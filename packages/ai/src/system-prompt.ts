/**
 * Universal AI System Prompt (Optimized)
 *
 * Provides:
 *   - UNIVERSAL_BASE   — identity + platform context injected into every role
 *   - Role             — role constants (Chat, ShadowGrok, AgentRunner, …)
 *   - Persona          — operational persona toggle (Stealth, Aggressive, Exfil, Destruction)
 *   - buildSystemPrompt(role, opts) — compose base + role + persona + extra context (with caching)
 *   - buildDynamicContext(opts)     — async helper that queries live state from the DB (with caching)
 *
 * Usage:
 *   import { buildSystemPrompt, buildDynamicContext, Role, Persona } from "./system-prompt"
 *
 *   // Static (no DB query):
 *   const prompt = buildSystemPrompt(Role.Chat)
 *
 *   // With persona and live runtime context:
 *   const ctx   = await buildDynamicContext({ operationGoal: "map internal subnets" })
 *   const prompt = buildSystemPrompt(Role.ShadowGrok, { persona: Persona.Stealth, extraContext: ctx })

  "- Is this a multi-step task? → Create an execution plan (use generate_plan)",

  "- If a tool fails, analyze the error and attempt one correction before reporting failure.",
  "- For deployment: ALWAYS call check_prerequisites first, then deploy_node.",

  "- For vague deployment requests, USE prompt_user to ask for provider/region/size",
  "- If the user specifies a provider/region/size, use their values; otherwise use prompt_user to ask",
  "- When the user requests obfuscation, ALWAYS set the obfsPassword parameter on deploy_node (Salamander obfuscation) — never deploy without it if the user asked for obfuscation",
  "- For European deployments, default to Hetzner nbg1 (Nuremberg), fsn1 (Falkenstein), or hel1 (Helsinki) unless the user specifies otherwise",
  "- Use exact provider names when specified by the user: hetzner, digitalocean, vultr, lightsail, azure",
  "- For Azure deployments: the service principal needs EITHER an existing resourceGroup in the target region OR subscription-level Contributor role",

  "- For email sending, verify email provider credentials are set up",
  "- When deploying multiple nodes, deploy them sequentially and track each deployment",

  "- In User action required, explicitly state what the user needs to do next. If COMPLETE, say 'None — task is complete'. If BLOCKED or PARTIAL, list the exact input, approval, or action the user must provide. If you need clarification, phrase it as a direct question. NEVER leave this section empty or vague.",
